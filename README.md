# Bank_application

This bank application allows the user to:

    1. Open an account
    2. Balance enquiry (ask for the balance of an account)
    3. Deposit (deposit some money in an account)
    4. Withdrawal (withdraw some money from an account)
    5. Close an account
    6. Show all accounts (show all the data of the existing accounts)
    7. Quit (to end the program)

Each account presents the following data: account number, first name, second name and balance.The program creates a text file where all the data of the accounts that are created and operated by the user is stored. When the program starts, it reads all the data from this file.
I did this bank application as the final project of the course: Learn C++ Programming -Beginner to Advance- Deep Dive in C++ (https://www.udemy.com/course/cpp-deep-dive/).
